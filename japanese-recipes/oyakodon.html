    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oyakodon is a traditional Japanese dish that consists of chicken and egg cooked together in a savory broth and
        served over rice. The name means “parent and child” rice bowl, because it uses both chicken and egg. It is a
        simple, comforting, and delicious meal that can be made in less than 30 minutes. There are different variations
