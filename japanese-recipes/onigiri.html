    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onigiri is a Japanese food that consists of cooked rice shaped into balls or triangles and often wrapped in nori
        seaweed. Onigiri can be plain or filled with various ingredients, such as pickled plum, salted salmon, or tuna
        mayonnaise. Onigiri is a popular snack or lunch item in Japan, as it is easy to make, carry, and eat. Onigiri
        has a long history in Japanese culture and cuisine, dating back to the 8th century. Onigiri is sometimes
        confused with sushi, but they are different dishes. Sushi rice is seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, while
        onigiri rice is usually plain or lightly salted. Onigiri is a simple and delicious way to enjoy rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To make onigiri, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Japanese short-grain rice (also called sushi rice or koshihikari rice)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>Furikake (rice seasoning) or your choice of filling (such as pickled plum, salted salmon, tuna mayonnaise, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your hands and moisten them with water. Sprinkle some salt on your palms.</li>
        <li>Take about 1/2 cup of rice and shape it into a ball. You can also use a triangle onigiri mold or a cup to help you form the shape.</li>
        <li>Make a small indentation in the center of the rice ball and add about 1 teaspoon of furikake or filling. Cover the filling with more rice and press lightly to seal.</li>
        <li>Wrap a strip of nori seaweed around the rice ball. You can also cover the entire rice ball with nori if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining rice and fillings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it! You can enjoy onigiri right away or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. You can also freeze them for up to a month and reheat them in the microwave when you want to eat them. Enjoy.</p>
