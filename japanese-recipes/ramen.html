    <h2 class="ramen">Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen is a popular dish that originated from China and was adapted by Japan. It is a soup of noodles and broth,
        flavored with various seasonings and toppings. Ramen can be made with different types of noodles, broth, and
        toppings, depending on the region and preference of the cook, which is why there are so many variations of
        ramen. The recipe here will cover a very popular variation of ramen, tonkotsu ramen.</p>
    <p>Tonkotsu ramen is a type of ramen that originated from Fukuoka, Japan. It is made with a rich and creamy broth
        that is cooked from pork bones for several hours, giving it a milky and collagen-filled texture. The broth is
        seasoned with soy sauce, salt, miso, or other ingredients, and served with thin and straight noodles. The ramen
        is usually topped with sliced pork belly, soft-boiled eggs, green onions, and other toppings that add flavor and
        contrast to the soup. Although Japanese ramen is a rather complex dish and sometimes requires years of training
        for even the best of Japanese chefs to get right, we've prepared a tonkotsu ramen recipe outlined below.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="ramen">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the broth, rinse the pork bones and chicken bones under cold water and place them in a large pot.
            Cover with water and bring to a boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat and
            simmer for about
            an hour, skimming occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, ginger, leek, green onions, and shiitake mushrooms to the pot. Simmer for another
            hour, or until the broth is rich and creamy. You may need to add more water as it evaporates.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the solids. Transfer the broth to a clean pot and
            keep warm over low heat. You should have about 8 cups of broth.</li>
        <li>To make the chashu (sliced pork), season the pork belly with salt and pepper and roll it up tightly. Tie it
            with kitchen twine and place it in a baking dish. Add enough water to cover half of the pork and cover with
            foil.
            Bake in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for about an hour and a half, or until tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork from the baking dish and let it rest for about 10 minutes. Slice thinly and set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the soft-boiled eggs, bring a pot of water to a boil and carefully lower the eggs into it. Cook for
            about six minutes, then transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Peel the eggs and cut
            them in half.</li>
        <li>To make the seasonings, combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, mirin, sake, garlic oil, and
            chili oil in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>To cook the noodles, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the noodles. Cook according to the package
            directions, then drain and rinse under cold water.</li>
        <li>To assemble the ramen bowls, divide the noodles among four large bowls. Add some seasonings to each bowl and
            ladle some hot broth over them. Mix well to dissolve the seasonings. Top with chashu slices, egg halves,
            green
            onions, bean sprouts, sesame seeds, and more chili oil if desired.</li>
    </ol>
